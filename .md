Again, we are ommiting any unnecessary elements and keeping things extra skim and keep better overview.

As we mentioned in the [first part](/posts/react-introduction-pt1) of the article, The ReactDOM renders its new elements in an HTML *element* which carries the *id* of *'root'* in our original DOM. Lets place one such element inside of our <span class='command'>index.html</span> file.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <body>
      <div id='root'>
         <!-- ReactDOM will render stuff here! -->
      </div>
   </body>
</html>
```
