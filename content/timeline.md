### Somewhat random facts in, somewhat, chronological order: 

* First time I heard of Computer Science was in 6th grade. They called it *Informatika* and it was a part of an after school program. Typed the first commands into *Basic* and watched my teacher write inÂ *Pascal*.

* The first computer I ever laid my hands on: ***Commodore 64***

* The first computer I ever called my own: ***Atari 1040st*** 
> ![](/assets/content/atari.jpeg)

* After graduating from the Electrotechnical Vocational school in former **Yugoslavia**, on a track to study to become an Electrical engineer, life took some unexpected turns and I found myself enrolling on a scholarship in the undergraduate program at **Berklee College of Music** in **Boston**, **MA**.

* Started to make websites while in college.

* After getting my Music Degree, as I worked in music full time, I continued to dabble in Web Development. 

* Discovered the classic CS text *Structure And Interpretation of Computer Programs*. With a strong background in music, I felt like a musician even when I wrote software. Ever since I implemented my first algorithm and watched the several lines of code in their little recursive dance, programming has reflected a lot of meaning for me, kind of like music.

* Completed *Software Engineering Immersive* at **General Assembly**, **NY** during the lockdown in 2020.

### Other Areas of Interest

* I like photography. In particular works of *Garry Winogrand, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Frank, Walker Evans, Lee Friedlander, Josef Koudelka, Alex Webb,* and many others.

* I like writing music and I perform with my band on most weekends. Sometimes I like to write music education materials like [this one](https://www.soundslice.com/store/koran-agan-waltzes/).
