### I made my first website in 1998
When people would engage in “surfing” the wild west that the Internet once was. When content was at the forefront, never spoon-fed to us and we were let (allowed?) to discover it on our own. Yes, I do feel nostalgic about those times. But I am also very excited about where we are today. It’s a great time to develop software for the web.

Be it as a one-man shop or working together with a large engineering team, throughout the years I helped many place their unique ideas into this digital space. In 2018 I started **FormVsContent**, a place where I can share my projects, experiment, and [ponder](/blog).
